In this project, we were tasked to make a blog for a company with functions to register a user, login, create posts, edit posts, and view posts.

## Description

This project is mainly focused on fetch GET, POST, and PUT. The back end for this project is handled by the Noroff API. The user stories completed for this project are:
- carousel which displays the three most recent posts
- grid of all posts
- register user
- login for user
- create a post
- View posts
- edit posts
- delete posts

For the design, I wanted to create something clean and simple. I also wanted to experiment with scroll animations to tie the design together.
